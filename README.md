# Physics-Jet-Simulator-3D
Simulates a particle shower caused by a parton splitting after a high-energy particle collision.

Starting with an initial 3D momentum of a parton, the parton is split like a binary tree (into 2 each time). The ratios of the momentums of the split particles, the angle at which they split, and the azimuthal angle all have elements of randomness to them.

To run the simulator, enter:
python jet_sim_3d.py
